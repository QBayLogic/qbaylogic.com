QBayLogic is a digital design and consultancy company. Our focus is on
leveraging FPGA technology in domains with difficult mathematical problems and
solutions that need low latency and high performance.

Our [team](/team/) has a strong affinity for both mathematics and embedded
systems. This allows us to quickly achieve a deep understanding of the
algorithms in any domain. Due to the strong basis in mathematics and
formal logic of our [technology](/technology/), we often refer to algorithm
implementations as "mathematics in typewriter font". From such an initial
implementation, we can formally derive a new implementation that meats the
performance criteria in a correct-by-construction manner.
